# Summary

The project aims to develop an interactive analytics dashboard using Angular and Dockview to visualize sales data effectively. It emphasizes modularity and code reusability through base classes and standardized components, provides interactive visualizations with Plotly, and implements inter-panel communication via an event-driven architecture. The end goal is a fully responsive, maintainable, and intuitive UI for dynamic data exploration.

## Accomplishments:

- Successfully integrated Dockview with Angular for panel management and layout control.

- Implemented a flexible, theme-based styling approach supporting multiple visual themes.

- Created reusable base plot components leveraging Plotly for interactive charts.

- Established robust inter-component communication through an EventBus architecture.

- Developed responsive visualizations that adapt dynamically to resizing panels.

## Remaining tasks:

1. Complete migration of all analytics panels to utilize the newly created base plotting component.

2. Restore full inter-panel interaction, specifically re-enable filtering and highlighting functionality via EventBus across all panels.

3. Refactor existing components to fully adhere to Angular best practices, including optimized lifecycle management and error handling.

4. Implement automated testing to ensure reliability of event-driven interactions and visualization responsiveness.

5. Document and deploy the final version of the application for broader user testing and feedback.
