## Remaining Tasks

1. **Migrate All Panels**: Transition all analytics panels to use the new base Plotly component.
2. **Re-enable Interactions**: Restore full inter-panel filtering and highlighting through the EventBus system.
3. **Refactor for Best Practices**: Update components to align with Angular lifecycle management, error handling, and code quality standards.
4. **Automated Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests for the EventBus and visualization logic to ensure stability and correctness.
5. **Documentation & Deployment**: Finalize technical documentation and deploy the application for broader user feedback and testing.
