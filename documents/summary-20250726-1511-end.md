# Project Summary

This project focuses on developing an interactive analytics dashboard using **Angular** and **Dockview** to deliver an effective and modular interface for visualizing sales data. It emphasizes maintainability, reusability, and dynamic interactivity, leveraging technologies such as **Plotly** for charting and an **EventBus** architecture for inter-panel communication.

## Important:

We are constrained to functionality of Angular Version 13.3 and dockview-core@4.4.0 and cannot use any functionality in
either that was introduced at a later revision level.

## Key Accomplishments

- ‚úÖ **Dockview Integration**: Successfully integrated Dockview with Angular, enabling dynamic panel layout and management.
- üé® **Theme Support**: Developed a flexible, theme-based styling system supporting multiple visual modes.
- üìä **Reusable Plot Components**: Rebuilt `HistogramComponent` as a shared, input-driven Plotly renderer to unify charting across panels.
- üîÑ **EventBus Architecture**: Reestablished cross-panel communication using a typed EventBus with support for `selected`, `highlight`, and `clearHighlight` messages.
- üîÅ **Panel Refactoring**: All panel components (`Date`, `Company`, and `Product`) have been refactored to use the shared histogram renderer and decoupled from direct Plotly rendering.
- ‚úÖ **Dual Dockview Layout**: Implemented two vertically stacked Dockview containers.

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Dual Dockview Draggability**: All charts currently start in the top Dockview. Enable Drag/Drop between top and bottom dockview containers.
2. **Finalize `HistogramComponent` Contract**: Define clear `@Input()`/`@Output()` behaviors and standardize event handling across chart types.
3. **Complete Highlight Logic**: Implement visual feedback in panels when other panels emit highlight events.
4. **Automated Testing**: Introduce unit and integration tests covering event handling, inter-panel behavior, and rendering state.
5. **Documentation & Deployment**: Finalize technical documentation and prepare the application for external user testing and production deployment.
6. **Selection Box UX**: Improve UX after box select ‚Äî selection overlay should disappear after selection, and deselection should restore all-panel visibility.
7. **Popout Window Bug Fix**:
   - Selecting a bar in a popped-out "Sales by Date" chart no longer updates the "Company Sales" chart.
   - Upon closing the popout window, the chart correctly restores into the Dockview container, but the Plotly toolbar is lost.
   - The mouse crosshair remains "stuck" as if Plotly expects the user to finish a drag-selection action.

### Interaction between you and I

0. You will be given the tree listing for all source code. You must ask for me to upload the listing you need, and then follow Interaction Rule #4 when providing the patch.
1. Give only one instruction at a time and await confirmation before moving to next instruction.
2. For all code patches; Always give the directory and name of the file to be patched.
3. Only change the portion of a file required to apply a patch. All other parts of the file must remain unchanged.
4. Always provide the entire content of the file, from top to bottom, as it should appear after the patch is applied‚Äîno omissions. All additions or modifications must be marked clearly with comments like // PATCH START and // PATCH END. Do not skip or summarize any part of the file.
