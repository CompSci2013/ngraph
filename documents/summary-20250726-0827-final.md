# Project Summary

This project focuses on developing an interactive analytics dashboard using **Angular** and **Dockview** to deliver an effective and modular interface for visualizing sales data. It emphasizes maintainability, reusability, and dynamic interactivity, leveraging technologies such as **Plotly** for charting and an **EventBus** architecture for inter-panel communication.

## Key Accomplishments

- ✅ **Dockview Integration**: Successfully integrated Dockview with Angular, enabling dynamic panel layout and management.
- 🎨 **Theme Support**: Developed a flexible, theme-based styling system supporting multiple visual modes.
- 📊 **Reusable Plot Components**: Rebuilt `HistogramComponent` as a shared, input-driven Plotly renderer to unify charting across panels.
- 🔄 **EventBus Architecture**: Reestablished cross-panel communication using a typed EventBus with support for `selected`, `highlight`, and `clearHighlight` messages.
- 🔁 **Panel Refactoring**: All panel components (`Date`, `Company`, and `Product`) have been refactored to use the shared histogram renderer and decoupled from direct Plotly rendering.
- 🧼 **Code Hygiene**: Removed ViewChild hacks, imperative rendering, and ResizeObserver misuse in favor of Angular best practices.

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Resolve Chart Rendering Timing Issue**: Diagnose and permanently fix why input-driven `HistogramComponent` is receiving data but still not rendering any bars.
2. **Complete Highlight Logic**: Implement visual feedback in panels when other panels emit highlight events.
3. **Finalize `HistogramComponent` Contract**: Define clear `@Input()`/`@Output()` behaviors and standardize event handling across chart types.
4. **Automated Testing**: Introduce unit and integration tests covering event handling, inter-panel behavior, and rendering state.
5. **Documentation & Deployment**: Finalize technical documentation and prepare the application for external user testing and production deployment.
